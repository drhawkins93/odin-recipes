        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is one of my favorites. It will blow away anyone who comes over for dinner,
            and it's deceptively simple to make! Pair it with some homemade <a href="mashed-potatoes.html">mashed potatoes</a> and
            <a href="roasted-broccoli.html">roasted broccoli</a> and your date will be thoroughly impressed.
        </p>
        <p>If you don't already have a roasting pan, I highly recommend picking one up. You'll also
            need to plan ahead, since this dish is best prepared starting a day in advance.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One three- to six- pound raw chicken</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>Sage</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Celery</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, drain the chicken as much as possible. Coat the outside (top and bottom)
                in kosher salt, and leave uncovered in the fridge for at least twenty-four hours.
            </li>
            <li>When you are ready to start preparing the chicken, preheat the oven to 350.</li>
            <li>After the chicken has dry-brined overnight, its skin should be nice and dessicated.
                Remove the chicken from the fridge and let it sit out so it can get closer to room
                temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Soften the butter in the microwave. Finely mince the rosemary, thyme, and sage, and
                mix it into the butter.
            </li>
            <li>Rub the whole chicken down with the herb butter. Be sure to get as much as you can
                under the skin as well!
            </li>
            <li>Stuff the chicken with celery stalks and garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Bake the chicken for roughly two hours. You'll know when it's done when its internal
                temperature has reached 165 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>After removing the chicken from the oven, allow it to rest for at least twenty minutes
                before carving it.
            </li>
        </ol>
